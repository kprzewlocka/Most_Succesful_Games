# Most_Succesful_Games
This project shows the best years for video games 

* SQL Project to show most succesful games based on user scores, critics scores and game sales. 
* Developed in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
* Original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmjason2/videogamedata

I also made a visualization in Power BI showing most loved games by critics, by users and most selling games summed up. I showed how much games with each user score and critic score sold.
